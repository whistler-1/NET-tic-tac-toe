# NET Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a .NET project, just trying to create a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in the terminal. Multiplayer over a network would be cool, not sure what implementation to go with there, though. 

The plan is to commit directly to main until the game has a working skeleton, and then move to a stricter branch structure.
